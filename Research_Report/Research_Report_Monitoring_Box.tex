\chapter{Introduction}
This report is written in commision of the Citizen Data lab from Amsterdam. The main goal of this report is to avoid pitfalls and find solutions for making a open source data-gathering platform. Commisioner of this research is Wouter Meys, Lab Coordinator of the Citizen Data Lab. The reason for this research, along with a developed prototype is the lack of useful environmental data-loggers which also keep track of the GPS-coordinates. This is critical for the Citizen Data Lab when they are, what they call, 'mapping the city'.
